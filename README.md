# Substance-Use-Prediction-and-Pattern-Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing patterns and predicting substance use using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. The main objectives of this project are:
- To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA.
- To apply KMeans clustering to identify distinct groups within the dataset.
- To evaluate and predict substance use patterns using classification models.

## Features
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing high-dimensional data into components.
- **Clustering**: KMeans clustering was applied on PCA-reduced data to uncover hidden patterns.
- **Supervised Learning**:
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Data Processing**: Includes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for supervised models.
